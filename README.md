- HydroEcoLSTM is a Python package with a graphical user interface (GUI) for modeling hydro-ecological processes using Long short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network. 
- Please check [package documentation](https://hydroecolstm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details, especially about how to use HydroEcoLSTM without the GUI
- Here is the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJ5fv53XlV4CSTtnfrULRA) channel for tutorial videos on how to use HydroEcoLSTM with GUI.
- If you have any questions or want to report any issues, you can either report it in [GitHub](https://github.com/tamnva/hydroecolstm/issues) or [HydroEcoLSTM Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/hydroecolstm).
